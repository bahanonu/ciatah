INSTALLATION:

1. Unzip ndSparse.zip. 

2. Run ndstest.m a few times-- it tests the functionality of the class by 
running various array methods/operations and comparing with ordinary arrays.  
It will typically report maximum percent error of about 1e-5 (and this maximum
corresponds to single precision operations that it tests -- double precision
operations should give less error).



RECOMMENDED READING (in the following order).

1. Read "help ndSparse" 

2. Read "methods ndSparse" to get a sense of the range of operations currently
 overloaded by the class. (Optionally also, browse ndstest.m)
